# Pdfcreator
This is a simple app where the user will enter some content through a edittext and a pdf will be created based on their content.
The user also can view the pdf and all the possible features for viewing the pdf will be available there.

I use one github library and one external android library.
One is com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:2.8.2
And the other one is com.itextpdf:itextg:5.5.10
